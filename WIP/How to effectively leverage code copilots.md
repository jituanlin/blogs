Write down the usage before designing, and declare before implementing.

Instead of searching for reusable code, adopt a consistent naming strategy.

If a function, class, or component doesn't conflict, simply reimplement it. This approach highlights the importance of consistent naming strategies and modularization.

The cost of searching and reading often exceeds that of reimplementation.
